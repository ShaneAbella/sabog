<h1>Friends</h1>
<font color="yellow">
<p>My friends are my number one supporter in life when I'm feel emotionally , but I call them as
my second family.They are the true reason why I've changed alot,they are the reason for 
every success, they are my mentors.Having friends is not all about being enjoy and happy 
all the time but to learn also from them,friends sometimes lead to misunderstanding but
we strive to make it perfectly.Other people think that having friend is the cause
of misbehavioural attitude of the child, it is the person who choosen him/her to be in life
and not because of having friends, this will be a lesson for all that friends are not 
a bad influence.</p>
