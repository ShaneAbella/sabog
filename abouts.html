<br>

I am Shane P. Abella , 16 years old, studying at Notre Dame Religious Virgin Mary Cotabato City.
 The first time that I step in this school I really did make a big adjustment the study, attitude,responsibility,and to socialize with
 people around me and on my behalf I thank this institution in making me a better person.I always see the world different and admire people
 who have talents and skills but I hate people whose mouth is to big.I love to sing and dance it is my hobby whenever I don't have anything
 else to do around the house.I always dreamed of being a teacher but as I continue my journey with teacher and mentor around me I realize many
 things such as the struggle of being a teacher that is why being a teacher is now my third option carrier. I thank God always for bringing me 
here in this world to explore and experience the wonders of the world and sharing it  to my friends and family.It is a great honor to be apart
of each great memories in my past section which is Constancy, whether it is good or bad we have done in order for our satisfaction will be fed
, this section was our unforgettable moments of our life as grade 10 where we all suffered much from the requirements and all other performance
task but with that we learned to do our best on our outputs,but the most valuable thing that I have learned is to cooperate and work together
no matter how hard it is we are still bonded like magnets , it is not the grades that matter but our friendship is way beyond our grades 
because every human being need to have someone in there life no man is an island to live alone.I can still recall all the stupidity we did
it was a really fun experience to have my classmates that is why I thank God for every step of my journey in life,I will never give up until death
and I will for my love ones.
